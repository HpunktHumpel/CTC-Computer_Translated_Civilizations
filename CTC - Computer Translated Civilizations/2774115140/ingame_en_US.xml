			<Text>Now that we have talked about it for this reason, I will simply &quot;bullshit&quot; my poor point of view. What should you do after buying a physical album? The first is to judge the collection value. For example, the collection value of &quot;Lovelight&quot; (refer to the &quot;Alstroemeria&quot; encyclopedia interface for details) is obviously higher than the listening value.

If you don't buy such a set of equipment and just listen to it with your original headphones that are 9 yuan and 9 free shipping, are you worthy of such great music?
