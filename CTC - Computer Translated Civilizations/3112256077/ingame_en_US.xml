			<Text>The rebels were composed of subhuman slaves and lower-class human civilians. They had no strong industrial strength and financial resources, so where did they get the equipment and ammunition to continue the resistance? Of course, they attacked the enemy forces and seized their weapons and equipment for their own use. If we didn't have guns and cannons, the enemy would make them for us.</Text>

			<Text>The subhumans and humans who had been oppressed for a long time had a lot of anger and fire in their hearts. After the anti-aristocratic uprising broke out, this anger and fire became an indelible revolutionary enthusiasm in the hearts of the rebel soldiers. This supported the poorly equipped rebel troops and they would not give up fighting even when they were surrounded.</Text>

			<Text>The infantry units of the rebel army possess flexible and maneuverable tactics. Sparrow warfare is the guerrillas' powerful weapon against powerful enemies. The guerrillas and the militia form small teams that gather and disperse from time to time. While confusing and restraining the enemy, they can also deal a powerful blow to the enemy.</Text>
