Walking in Mond City as a bard, I found that the atmosphere in the city was extremely depressing. On the day of the Badminton Festival, I played &quot;Song of the Wind&quot;, which has not been played for a long time, to an Apple vendor, and was warned by the vendor, &quot;Don't touch that shuttlecock.&quot; During the celebration, I found out about the absurd and brutal behavior of the nobleman, stepped forward to snatch the badminton to play with the nobleman, was chased and killed by the soldiers, met Vanessa on the way to escape, and got her cover. Vanessa was arrested for offending the nobles. Wendy got the cell key that night and entered the cell to talk to Vanessa. Wendy wants to escape Mund with Vanessa and her people. But Vanessa said that her people have forgotten the meaning of &quot;freedom&quot;, and they have to participate in the duel on the second day anyway to awaken the people's sense of resistance and freedom, otherwise they will only be shackled by another power. .</Text>

At this time, Wendy suddenly appeared, guided the power of the wind to make Vanessa hit the dragon, and used divine power to order the dragon to retreat. At this time, Wendy asked to write Vanessa into the poem, and was agreed, saying that this would be a new chapter with the Vanessa family as the protagonist. In the end, Lawrence was asked to follow the rules and hand over control of Mond. In addition, by forging Morax's signature to create the &quot;Secret Treaty of Leeward&quot;, a large number of soldiers rebelled, and together with Vanessa, they overthrew the aristocratic rule. The followers of the wind god Barbatos form the Guardians of the Four Winds. Fengshen left again.</Text>
