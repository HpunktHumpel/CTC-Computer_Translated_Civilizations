As a role model in the hearts of Mond people, the new nobles are greatly respected and loved. They also keep in mind their obligations and strict self-discipline when enjoying the high courtesy of the people. This harmony between nobles and commoners has shaped the cultural germination of Mond. For example, noble lords hunted together with their subjects, and when they returned with their prey, the nobles shared the results with all the subjects. This was a major festival in the territory, and the nobles also showed their strength and generosity.</Text>

			<Text>However, with the passage of time, the life of the new aristocrats has become increasingly extravagant and corrupt, and the aristocrats have gradually forgotten their self-discipline based on moral responsibilities and regarded themselves as kings who were superior to ordinary people in the first place. Among the nobles, the Lawrence family has become the largest family and is the real ruler of Mond. Most of the other nobles are loyal to the Lawrence family while brutally suppressing the common people. The nobles headed by Lawrence used various methods to restrict the freedom of the common people. The church and court magisters also cooperated with the nobles to monopolize cultural knowledge to prevent the common people from understanding Mond’s past. Maintaining a hierarchical background, the statues on the square were replaced by towers, and became a symbol for the nobles to declare their power under the aristocratic autocracy. Commoners can only have limited entertainment during festivals, and Mond's famous literary masterpiece &quot;Mond's Tower&quot; reflects the fact that the church was the accomplice of the nobles' violent expropriation at that time. The corruption of the church also made some saints feel disappointed with the clergy, and went underground to propagate the original teachings to the common people. To a certain extent, the underground preaching maintained the continuation of the free faith of the Westwind Church. According to the &quot;Gunhild Biography&quot;, during this period, the Gunhild family still did not forget the original oath, trying to maintain the balance between the nobles and the common people, and safeguard the interests of the common people to the greatest extent. The Emon Roca family has not been mentioned in the existing historical materials, and their whereabouts are unknown.</Text>

			<Text>Afterwards, Barbatos-Wendy imparted his wisdom to the Mond people, modified the terrain of the current Mond area, migrated from Old Mond (now the ruins of Fenglong) and settled down, setting up many festivals and celebrations.

			<Text>About 1600 after the completion of New Mond, the nobles headed by the Lawrence family took control of Mond, and Wendy woke up again in response to the prayers of his followers. Walking in Mond City as a bard, I found that the atmosphere in the city was extremely depressing. On the day of the Badminton Festival, I played &quot;Song of the Wind&quot;, which has not been played for a long time, to an Apple vendor, and was warned by the vendor, &quot;Don't touch that shuttlecock.&quot; During the celebration, I found out about the absurd and brutal behavior of the nobleman, stepped forward to snatch the badminton to play with the nobleman, was chased and killed by the soldiers, met Vanessa on the way to escape, and got her cover. Vanessa was arrested for offending the nobles. Wendy got the cell key that night and entered the cell to talk to Vanessa. Wendy wants to escape Mund with Vanessa and her people. But Vanessa said that her people have forgotten the meaning of &quot;freedom&quot;, and they have to participate in the duel on the second day anyway to awaken the people's sense of resistance and freedom, otherwise they will only be shackled by another power. .</Text>

			<Text>The next day, the nobles shamelessly drove all the Vanessa clan out of the city, demanding that they defeat the dragon Uzzah, and shot and killed the retreating people with arrows. At this time, Wendy suddenly appeared, guided the power of the wind to make Vanessa hit the dragon, and used divine power to order the dragon to retreat. At this time, Wendy asked to write Vanessa into the poem, and was agreed, saying that this would be a new chapter with the Vanessa family as the protagonist. In the end, Lawrence was asked to follow the rules and hand over control of Mond. In addition, by forging Morax's signature to create the &quot;Secret Treaty of Leeward&quot;, a large number of soldiers rebelled, and together with Vanessa, they overthrew the aristocratic rule. The followers of the wind god Barbatos form the Guardians of the Four Winds. Fengshen left again.</Text>
