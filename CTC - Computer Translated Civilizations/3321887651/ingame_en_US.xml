			<Text>The story revolves around the appearance of five magical girls one after another. Born in a good family, reuniting with relatives and friends, crying and laughing, this is the daily life that everyone has. Madoka Kaname, a second-year girl studying at the Municipal Mitakihara Junior High School, lives such an ordinary and happy life every day. The appearance of a mysterious transfer student, Homura Akemi, began to change Madoka's fate. [NEWLINE] On the way home, Madoka Kaname and her friends discovered that Homura was holding a weapon and hunting a scarred mysterious creature named Kyubey. After the storm, Kyubey hopes that the girls will sign a contract with him and become &quot;magical girls&quot; to protect mankind. As her dreams were shattered by the cruel reality, Madoka Kaname's thoughts were also ruthlessly impacted by the dark truth of the magical girls...</Text>

			<Text>In this story, Madoka is a second-year student at the Municipal Mitakihara Junior High School, living with her parents and younger brother. She has pink shoulder-length curly short hair, a friendly and gentle personality, and hates fighting. At the same time, she is a little strict and unconfident about herself. She is an ordinary girl who longs to grow up and looks forward to the future. An incredible encounter changed her originally peaceful life. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE] A highly intelligent life form called QB, using &quot;any wish can be fulfilled&quot; as bait, extracts human souls and turns girls who do not know the truth into so-called &quot;magical girls&quot;, and the despair that follows turns them into depraved beings that are difficult for humans to understand - witches. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE] QB draws energy from this transformation to reverse the increase in the entropy of the universe, but leaves humans with heavy despair. The magical girls live in a world full of witch curses and suffer terribly. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE] Senior Mami Tomoe, who was admired by the magical girls as a senior, was killed by a witch; her playmate Sayaka Miki turned into a witch out of despair... [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE] After experiencing a series of brutal battles with her companions, in the final episode of the TV version, she made a wish to QB to &quot;destroy all witches in the past and future before they are formed&quot;, thus destroying all witches in the past/present/future (including herself), and she moved to a higher realm and existed as a concept. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE] The magical girls other than Homura Akemi have completely forgotten the name &quot;Madoka Kaname&quot;, and only worship her as the god of hope and salvation &quot;Circle of Principles&quot;. Even Madoka's parents have basically forgotten Madoka's existence, and only her younger brother Tatsuya still has a vague impression of Madoka Kaname.</Text>

			<Text>In the new story, when she came down to earth as the Principle of the Circle to welcome Homura Akemi who was about to become a witch, she was affected by the trap of QB and lost her memory. However, she recovered her memory because she arranged for two messengers, Sayaka Miki and Nagisa Momoe, to come down to earth together. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE] However, during her amnesia, she revealed to Homura her longing for an ordinary life, causing Homura to regret acquiescing to Madoka's wish. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE] In the end, although she and everyone else broke the barrier of QB, when she was about to purify Homura's soul gem, Homura forcibly separated her &quot;records of her time as a human&quot; and she turned into a human form and lived on the earth again. Her identity became the same as Homura's original identity, a transfer student returning from the United States, and her memory was tampered with by Homura along with everyone else.</Text>

			<Text>Related Witches: [NEWLINE] &quot;The Witch of Rescue&quot; (Kriemhild Gretchen), whose nature is mercy. Her posture is like that of a tree with countless connected roots, and she is proud of her huge difference in size from other witches. There is no physical means of death, but all life on earth will be forcibly absorbed into the new heaven she created (actually a witch's barrier). Xiaomei Yan also tied up the thread of cause and effect in the parallel world while repeatedly going backwards in time, which made it become a stronger and larger existence. If you want to defeat this witch, you have no choice but to eliminate all misfortune in the world. If sadness no longer exists in this world, the witch will mistakenly think that this is heaven and destroy herself. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE] &quot;The Witch of Despair&quot; (Despair's Witch) is a forceful complainer. The representative of all the magical girls who died despite their efforts and all the hopes that were not realized. An air doll that was born from the mud of despair at the same time as the hope that could rewrite the universe was born. It gathered endless screams into one body and thus continued to expand. As long as the cause and effect of the magical girl continues to circulate, this witch will expand to an even more abnormal size, and eventually even the galaxy will be unable to bear its size and collapse. Strictly speaking, the &quot;Witch of Despair&quot; is not Madoka's witch, or even anyone's witch, but she was indeed born from Madoka's last wish.</Text>

			<Text>She has a beautiful appearance, but her words are always ambiguous and confusing; she rarely has facial expressions. She seems calm and self-sustaining, but in fact, she will flash a surprised expression when she encounters an unexpected situation. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE] She intervenes in the causal relationship between the four magical girls as a &quot;third party interferer&quot;. She claims that &quot;I am a partner of smart people and an enemy of fools who stir up trouble&quot; (said to Sakura Kyoko). She seems to have no sympathy for other people's experiences, but in fact she is just hiding her inner feelings. (As Saito Chiwa said, after her attempt to kill Miki Sayaka failed, her inner struggle was manifested in her hysteria towards Kaname Madoka.) [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE] In the initial timeline, she was very timid and inferior because of her poor grades and poor health. After being helped by Kaname Madoka, she was gradually infected and became lively and confident, and regarded Kaname Madoka as her best friend. However, in the process of saving Kaname Madoka countless times, her hope gradually disappeared, and she became a cold personality. Chiwa Saito and Ao-chan commented that knowing a lot of things but not being able to say them out loud is the pain of Homura Akemi. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]During her hospital stay, Homura had to wear two braids according to medical requirements to facilitate surgery, so the ends of her hair were later split into two halves. In the anime, Homura will occasionally touch her hair, especially when she has thoughts. For example, in the 11th episode of the TV anime, when she was trying to find an excuse to stop Madoka from becoming a magical girl, she was about to touch her hair but stopped, but Madoka still noticed it. When touching her hair, Homura usually uses her left hand, but after she turned into a demon in the movie &quot;The Rebellion&quot;, she changed to using her right hand to touch her hair.</Text>

			<Text>Related witches: [NEWLINE] Apart from the same name (both Homulilly), the Witch of this Coast that appears in the PSP game and the Nutcracker Witch that appears in the theatrical version have completely different images, properties, and familiars. Here we introduce both of them separately. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE] In the PSP version of &quot;Puella Magi Madoka Magica&quot;, if she loses the battle against the Witch of the Night, Homura Akami will transform into the &quot;Witch of this Shore&quot;. She has an image similar to the common image of a witch. The shield becomes a hat on top of the head, which is an old record player disc and also resembles a traditional medieval witch's pointed magic hat. The witch's body is shaped like a white hourglass, with gray-white dots inside symbolizing sand, and long braids on both sides. [NEWLINE] There is no mention of the witch nature in the PSP. Before Game Over, it was only shown with illustrations and was not recorded in the Witch Manual. It can be confirmed in the illustration collection included in the bonus disk. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE] The theatrical version is The Nutcracker Witch, whose nature is arbitrary (complete it by yourself). Her heroic demeanor of crushing countless seeds in the past has been damaged but there is nothing she can do about it. The last thing this witch with no other value longs for is her own execution. However, just decapitation cannot erase the witch's sins. This stupid witch repeats the reincarnation of the burial procession until she is executed on this shore. [NEWLINE] Form 1: A witch born from retreating hope. Wearing a pointed witch's magic hat, the hat is an old-style record player and a CD, depicting and playing the infinite reincarnation years that have been experienced. The mouth is bound by layers of ribbons, which at the same time restrains the desire to cry out for help from the principle of the circle, and attempts to cover up the powerlessness of oneself. The clothes on her body still retained her appearance when she was a magical girl. She was laughed at mercilessly by her familiar, and these clothes were eventually dissolved together with the past. [NEWLINE] Form 2: While mourning songs are playing, the detached head is trampled under the feet, and the funeral procession slowly walks towards the guillotine in handcuffs. The longing for God turns into manjus and sandals blooming on the top of the head, and will perish together with itself at the time of execution. The ribbons on the back are like hands constantly struggling, hindering the progress of the queue. The final unwillingness and struggle in the heart are so powerless in the face of the final despair. Teeth fell to the ground like tears, and the impatient child kept urging: &quot;There is no time for you to feel sad.&quot;</Text>

She was originally an innocent girl who loved her father very much. But later, due to family reasons, she became withdrawn. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE] She is a foodie. She eats different things every time she appears, such as waffles, taiyaki, egg rolls, Pocky, apples, popsicles, etc. She also likes instant noodles, French fries, and meatball skewers. She also gave Kaname Madoka a delicious yummy stick in episode 9. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE] As a magical girl beyond common sense, she can think and calculate gains and losses in a very realistic way, and rarely has unrealistic fantasies. She doesn't care about the disasters caused by witches, and only fights to seize the seeds of sorrow and use magic power at will. In Sayaka's eyes, she is the same as the &quot;cold-blooded&quot; Homura Akemi, and is the opposite of Asami, another form of magical girl. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]However, even though she changed her life creed and sealed off her old magic, Kyoko still couldn't completely let go of her past. On the surface, she looked down on Sayaka's idealism, and mixed sarcasm with her preaching (such as &quot;suggesting&quot; Sayaka to cripple Kyousuke so that she could completely possess him), but she subconsciously gave her unusual attention and became quite talkative, and couldn't bear to see Sayaka go to destruction. In the process of opposing Sayaka, she gradually found her original intention and even her faith. Madoka, who originally couldn't understand Kyoko's behavior, finally resonated with Kyoko and went on an adventure together to &quot;save Sayaka&quot;. Kyoko has been a loner for a long time. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]However, if there are magical girls who are equivalent to &quot;companions&quot;, she will show her open-minded and affectionate side in front of them.</Text>

			<Text>Related witches: [NEWLINE] Wudan Witch/Ophelia[NEWLINE] [NEWLINE] Kyoko's witch transformation turns her into Wudan Witch Ophelia, a self-abandoned witch who wanders forever in the misty, ethereal sound of footsteps, always accompanying her beloved horse. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE] The walls and floor of Wudan Witch's barrier are paved with a large number of dark red bricks, which is consistent with Kyoko's impression of her in her lifetime. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE] Wudan Witch and her familiars are also closely connected to her in her lifetime. Wudan Witch can use clone skills similar to Rosso Phantasma, and can also transform into a huge spear to attack. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE] Her familiars are Wudans who are also dressed in gorgeous costumes. One has a dragon head and is good at close combat, and the other can use long-range fire attacks and summon partners. The ability of the familiars reflects Kyoko's characteristics as a magical girl, when her spear was good at both close combat and range attacks. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]A red gem-shaped pendant hangs on the neck of the Wudan Witch's warhorse. Kyoko also had a cross pendant with a soul gem on her neck when she was alive. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]The final battle with the Wudan Witch takes place in a narrow corridor with both sides closed, which seems to be a reflection of the alley where Kyoko and Sayaka fought in the fifth episode of the TV series. And in such a narrow terrain, the Wudan Witch is most suitable for exerting the power of her clone. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]Many colorful fish can be seen swimming in the background of the Wudan Witch's barrier. They are not familiars but part of the background. Early Christians used fish to symbolize devout faith. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]One of the special abilities is to summon a defensive barrier, a hardened chain composed of red blocks, which is called the Binding Barrier in PSP. His other ability is mental suggestion (i.e. to confuse others. According to an interview with Gen Urobuchi, he can no longer use it). Because his wish destroyed his family, he decided not to use the ability brought by his wish (he sealed his ability himself).</Text>

			<Text>Asami is warm-hearted, gentle, and elegant. She has been guiding and leading her juniors as a senior since her debut. Some people thought that Asami and Kyubey kept persuading Madoka, Miki, and Sayaka to become magical girls, and they were suspected of deliberately dragging them into the water; but if you think about it carefully, Asami has no ill intentions. She doesn't even know the truth about magical girls and witches. What she did was just the most normal emotional expression of an ordinary girl: longing for companions, longing for magical girl partners who understand her and fight with her. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE] Asami has a past that she can't bear to look back on. Although she survived, she was alone with the responsibility of a magical girl and hunted witches in the town. Loneliness and solitude always accompany her. The only person she can confide in is Kyubey, who has no emotions. So it is not difficult to understand why Asami was so happy after meeting Madoka and Sayaka. Although she seems perfect on the outside, she cried with joy when Madoka Kaname decided to become a magical girl because she was no longer lonely. She also lost control after learning the truth about magical girls and began to kill her fellow magical girls, which shows her inner fragility. Senior Mami can be said to be one of the tragic characters in this work. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE] It is precisely because of Mami's loneliness and fragility that she is vulnerable when facing the cruel reality. In the third cycle of Homura Akemi, after learning the truth about the Soul Gem due to Sayaka Miki's transformation into a witch and being conquered, she was the first to shoot and smash Sakura Kyoko's Soul Gem. Just after she tied up Homura Akemi with a ribbon and finished her dialogue (&quot;If we can't stop the Soul Gem from giving birth to a witch, then isn't it just death?!&quot;), Madoka Kaname smashed her Soul Gem when she was about to execute her by firing squad.</Text>

[NEWLINE] [NEWLINE] Appears in the PSP version of the game Mami's blackened line: After the appearance of Homura Akemi, Madoka often stays with Homura, which makes Mami lonely. She is too desperate to become a witch because she recalls the failure of becoming a magical girl for the first time. She is the smallest among all witches, about the size of a flying insect.

The ribbon on her head has a binding skill, and she has an attack similar to Tiro Finale, but it shoots flames instead of magic ammunition.

[NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]Each witch summons a witch barrier, turning this alien space controlled by herself into a cage.

It is a fancy and elegant space, just like a tea party venue that appeared in a picture book. It can be seen that she is a witch who likes black tea. The tea set, the rainbow bridge, and the apple tree are side by side, but the sky with the opposite color makes people tremble. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]A kind witch who dreams of an ideal, this lonely witch will not let the guests who enter the barrier escape. &quot;Makeup&quot; and &quot;small size&quot; reflect Mami's psychological state that she tries her best to show reliability on the outside, but is actually fragile on the inside.

Their appearance and attack methods are very similar to Asami's former companions Sakura Kyoko, Kaname Madoka, and Sayaka. Their duty is to guide guests into the barrier to attend the tea party of the witch of beauty. They are good friends of the witch of beauty. When someone wants to escape from the party, they will tie up the hands and feet of the escapee. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]Obviously, the appearance and skills of the familiars are a reflection of Asami's obsession. After she turned into a witch, she hoped to have a never-ending tea party with her friends in the barrier to relieve her loneliness...</Text>

Listening to these concerts for a long time will make people lose their souls. The orchestra is everything to the witch of the &quot;Mermaid&quot;, and she is everything to the orchestra. The prototype may be Kyousuke Kamijou. The prototype of the familiar that appears in the tenth episode is Shizuku Hitomi. Her mission is to be a dancer. She dances energetically behind the witch all the time.</Text>

[NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]In [New Chapter], Nagisa's fighting style is quite special. She doesn't summon infinite weapons to attack like Asami and Sayaka, but summons various familiars (the familiars of many witches in the old world) to fight through an infinite cycle of &quot;face changing&quot;. In addition, she can also use her own weapon, the trumpet-shaped bubble machine, to blow some bubbles to hinder enemies or attacks.</Text>

			<Text>At the end of the TV anime, despite careful planning, Homura was defeated by Witch Night. When she was about to reincarnate again, she remembered what she had learned from the beast about her every tour. Because the repetition of time makes all the timelines converge together, and the quality of a magical girl is determined by the cause and effect on her body, reincarnation will only strengthen Madoka's quality to become a magical girl, which will only lead her to deeper despair. Homura realized that she was heading towards the inevitable desperate ending of all magical girls, and she shed tears in pain. When she was about to turn evil, she suddenly felt Madoka holding her hand. In order to live up to Homura's long-term protection for her and the deep hope she placed on her, Madoka took a deep breath: [NEWLINE] &quot;I want to destroy all witches before they are born! I want to destroy all witches in the universe, the past, and the future with my own hands!&quot; [NEWLINE] QB: &quot;If that wish comes true, it will not only interfere with time, but also violate the law of causality itself. Do you really want to become a god!!!&quot; [NEWLINE] &quot;It doesn't matter if I become a god! I don't want to make those magical girls who have held hope cry. I hope they can all walk to the end with a smile. I will destroy and change the rules that hinder this - this is my wish, my wish! Come! Make it happen! Incubator!&quot; [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE] So Madoka went back to the past, traveled through the future, and took on the pain and despair of all the magical girls before they turned evil. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]However, although this wish can create a universe, the curse and despair it brings are enough to destroy a universe. However, Madoka's wish is to destroy all witches including himself, so he destroys his dark self with his own hands. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]According to QB's commentary, from now on, Madoka's life has no beginning and end, and all her footprints on Earth will be erased; Madoka's existence is elevated to a higher dimension, and only the concept of &quot;Circle Principle&quot; is left in the original dimension. No one can perceive its physical existence, and no one can interact with Madoka, and it is no longer a part of this dimension.</Text>
