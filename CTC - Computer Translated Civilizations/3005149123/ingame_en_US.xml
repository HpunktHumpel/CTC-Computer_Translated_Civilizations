As a role model in the hearts of Mond people, the new nobles are greatly respected and loved. They also keep in mind their obligations and strict self-discipline when enjoying the high courtesy of the people. This harmony between nobles and commoners has shaped the cultural germination of Mond. For example, noble lords hunted together with their subjects, and when they returned with their prey, the nobles shared the results with all the subjects. This was a major festival in the territory, and the nobles also showed their strength and generosity.</Text>

			<Text>However, with the passage of time, the life of the new aristocrats has become increasingly extravagant and corrupt, and the aristocrats have gradually forgotten their self-discipline based on moral responsibilities and regarded themselves as kings who were superior to ordinary people in the first place. Among the nobles, the Lawrence family has become the largest family and is the real ruler of Mond. Most of the other nobles are loyal to the Lawrence family while brutally suppressing the common people. The nobles headed by Lawrence used various methods to restrict the freedom of the common people. The church and court magisters also cooperated with the nobles to monopolize cultural knowledge to prevent the common people from understanding Mond’s past. Maintaining a hierarchical background, the statues on the square were replaced by towers, and became a symbol for the nobles to declare their power under the aristocratic autocracy. Commoners can only have limited entertainment during festivals, and Mond's famous literary masterpiece &quot;Mond's Tower&quot; reflects the fact that the church was the accomplice of the nobles' violent expropriation at that time. The corruption of the church also made some saints feel disappointed with the clergy, and went underground to propagate the original teachings to the common people. To a certain extent, the underground preaching maintained the continuation of the free faith of the Westwind Church. According to the &quot;Gunhild Biography&quot;, during this period, the Gunhild family still did not forget the original oath, trying to maintain the balance between the nobles and the common people, and safeguard the interests of the common people to the greatest extent. The Emon Roca family has not been mentioned in the existing historical materials, and their whereabouts are unknown.</Text>
