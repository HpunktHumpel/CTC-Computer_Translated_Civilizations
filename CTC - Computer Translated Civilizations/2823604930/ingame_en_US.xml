			<Text>In the past, the great nobles could enjoy a stable prosperity by relying on their bloodline, but in modern times, their status was challenged by the emerging business and political elites.
In some countries, such as Colombia, the status of well-known companies is almost equivalent to the bloodline of other countries. Of course, a small noble is not as rich as the general manager of a Colombian company. Industry and commerce continue to develop, and many visionary nobles are trying to transform their land and entourage into capital.
However, in more classical countries, such as Ursus, such a transformation is slow and painful. At least before the great rebellion, the great nobles still held most of the right to speak. If it were not for that accident, the political structure of Ursus might not have changed at all.</Text>

			<Text>According to Zaolu's description, the Rostov family she belonged to was one of the new nobles that emerged after the Great Rebellion. They were originally just followers of a certain count, but they got everything that originally belonged to the count.
Count Boris, the mayor of Chernobog, was also one of the new nobles. The two families hit it off and ran businesses in Chernobog, either overt or covert, which gave her family a high status in Chernobog.
Of course, all this was wiped out with the destruction of Chernobog.</Text>

During his control of the school, Mephisto did not interfere with the students' actions at all, but did not allow any students to leave the school.

She took the initiative to tell these experiences, on the one hand, because she trusts Rhodes Island and the Doctor, and on the other hand, because she thinks that she is probably the most suitable person to be a &quot;traitor&quot; in the Autonomous Group and tell these things, and she hopes that the Doctor can do the one thing she cannot do - help her companions.</Text>

At the same time, thanks to Zaolu's experience as the president of the Student Union, Zaolu also has certain means in diplomacy, which can gain the trust of the city-state more quickly. At the same time, with the research and development of [ICON_Science] technology and [ICON_Culture] municipal administration, more [ICON_VIEW_TRADE] trade routes can be obtained. At the same time, Zaolu can also provide a lot of bonuses for ranged units. Thanks to this, conquering victory has also become an optional option.
