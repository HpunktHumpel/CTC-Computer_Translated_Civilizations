			<Text>The Karlan Trade CO.,LTD. is a state-owned enterprise engaged in foreign trade. It is located in the religious country of Kjerag, also known as the 'Snow Realm.'[NEWLINE]Because of its terrain, Kjerag rarely suffers natural Catastrophes or invasions. This has meant that the people of Kjerag have not needed to rely on nomadic cities to live and work. Of course, the steep terrain has also slowed Kjerag's development considerably.[NEWLINE]The name of the Karlan Trade Company is probably derived from the name of the holy mountain the believers of Kjerag worship.[NEWLINE]The trade company, run by SilverAsh, is the only window to the outside world for the insular and conservative nation of Kjerag. At the same time, this company has unavoidably changed the country.[NEWLINE]It would be wise for Rhodes Island to research SilverAsh's record, given this level of power and vision.</Text>

			<Text>As a lover of literature and art, a committed hunter and collector, and an expert in traditional Kjerag swordsmanship, SilverAsh has traces of a traditional noble upbringing.[NEWLINE]That said, SilverAsh's thinking and conduct run counter to tradition, and are full of the progressive complexity and the intensity of modern education.[NEWLINE]As such, SilverAsh, Chairman of the Kjerag Trade Co. LTD, is a controversial figure at Rhodes Island.[NEWLINE]Whatever the case, the other Operators have come to a consensus: SilverAsh is not an Operator who can be easily dispatched or controlled.[NEWLINE]SilverAsh and his employees work very closely with Rhodes Island, but there is no hierarchical relationship between them.[NEWLINE]Whether it is strategic planning or tactical command, many Operators find SilverAsh's prowess convincing. However, the more skeptical Operators familiar with conspiracy and political tricks are wary of SilverAsh's intentions.[NEWLINE]Although SilverAsh truly cares about his younger sister, Cliffheart, who is being treated at Rhodes Island, he trusts Rhodes Island no more than Rhodes Island trusts him.[NEWLINE]Perhaps as the rumor says, what is really of interest to SilverAsh is the value of Rhodes Island Pharmaceuticals itself as well as the Doctor he regards as a competent rival...</Text>

			<Text>According to rumor, SilverAsh's parents died in a so-called accident when he was a child. Despite the ruling, evidence at the scene pointed to foul play by political enemies of the Silverash clan. Perhaps because of the rapid decline of the Silverash Family, this matter was left unsettled.[NEWLINE]Naturally, the incident had a huge effect on young SilverAsh's life. But as SilverAsh was the scion of a wealthy family and not a weakling by any means, he never sank into despair, and even kept raising his two younger sisters until they were old enough to take care of themselves.[NEWLINE]Thereafter, SilverAsh left Kjerag and headed to Victoria to receive a modern education, and let the Silverash family's political enemies divide up their legacy amongst themselves. The Three House Parliament of Kjerag was three houses in name only.[NEWLINE]This state of affairs lasted until SilverAsh returned back to Kjerag. Upon his homecoming, the young master took upon himself the weighty responsibility of rebuilding his clan.[NEWLINE]Now according to Cliffheart's testimony, the SilverAsh who had returned was no longer the gentle and precocious youngster he used to be, who would grit his teeth and bear all that the world threw at him.[NEWLINE]Thereafter, the Karlan Trade Company quickly rose to seize a monopoly in a large number of modern industries that had previously been banned in Kjerag. He exported goods and raw materials to other countries and imported modern industrial products. In doing so, he accumulated a vast amount of wealth in a very short time, and the success of his company restored the Silverash Family name to its position in the parliament.[NEWLINE]In what may have been a series of plays by rival clans, SilverAsh's two younger sisters each suffered a turn of fortune that would have a huge impact on the Silverash family: Pramanix was christened a Karlan Saintess in a religious ritual, and Cliffheart was infected with Oripathy.[NEWLINE]Rhodes Island tends to believe that these were acts of political opposition, but Cliffheart thinks that these events merely once again catalyzed SilverAsh's resolve.[NEWLINE]Now, no one knows what SilverAsh will do, just as no one knows the purpose behind his collaboration with Rhodes Island.</Text>

They follow Heaven's Road up the mountain to the Residence of the Gods. Once they hang the trial bell upon its hook there, the trial is over. En route, it is customary for the girl to nod her head every three steps and ring the bell every five. Those who break this custom lose their chance to become saints. The new saint is born from the thawing snow on the second day. Because Heaven's Road is long and winding, the trial is very severe. Some give up immediately. Others collapse on the side of the road.

			<Text>His codename Gnosis, meaning "knowledge" or "insight," is said to be his real name.

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_GNOSIS_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_3" Language="en_US">
			<Text>Since the earliest records of Kjerag's history, Gnosis's family–the Edelweisses–were keepers of precious documents and ancestry records for the whole region. Thus, the whole family's calling from generation to generation was to protect, write, and manage these records.[NEWLINE]Gnosis's obsession with research comes from these ancestral duties.[NEWLINE]It could be said Gnosis serves as an ideal researcher.[NEWLINE]He has next to no desires, and has practically no interest in anything outside of research. He possesses the proactiveness and competence to transform his ideas into reality, electing to personally lead teams to obtain any necessary materials or tools that cannot be found at Rhodes Island. And once he concentrates on his research, he becomes a precise instrument–in the several experiments he's taken part in, he's never once made the slightest mistake.[NEWLINE]At the same time, he's also rather apathetic regarding life and morality. We find it hard to call this a strong point, but it must be recognized that a portion of scientists hold moral stances different from an ordinary person, and prominent figures among these scientists often make startling breakthroughs not endorsed by common ethics. Rhodes Island by no means believes that ways of thinking that fall below our standards are needed to promote advancement in science, but we are unable to deny that the purer the scientist, the more likely they are to show deviation on moral issues. And for matters relating to the Infected, this goes doubly so.[NEWLINE]This aspect of Gnosis was initially the focus of a high-level investigation, since a researcher of his caliber would undoubtedly be an asset to Rhodes Island, but if he was unable to identify with our perspective on the Infected, or was unwilling to abide by our policies, then we would be forced to part ways.[NEWLINE]Gnosis did not disappoint us. He even surprised us with his willingness to conduct research related to the Infected following Rhodes Island's standard procedures.[NEWLINE]In fact, when we submitted this requirement, he wasn't the least bit surprised. Presumably this was not because of whatever views he has on the Infected, but rather because he was already used to working under such constraints.</Text>

			<Text>The Silverashes and Edelweisses have always been close, with the two families' children growing up alongside each other and being jointly educated as a matter of course. SilverAsh and Gnosis are no exception.[NEWLINE]Unlike the numerous relatively radical policies SilverAsh implemented after founding Karlan Trade, his father–Olafur Silverash–was quite moderate and thus did not meet any opposition from the conservatives of Kjerag when first establishing its variegated industrial foundations. Thanks to his firm character and skilled finesse, Olafur was quite loved and respected in Kjerag, a world apart from SilverAsh's future situation. Of course, we know by now that there were reasons that SilverAsh could not avoid this.[NEWLINE]In brief, while Olafur and his wife may have been the fiends that sullied Kjerag in the eyes of some its more obstinate people, to the majority they had always been a model couple that thought of the citizens as they led them.[NEWLINE]The couple's death was first assumed to have been plotted by Gnosis's father, but was ultimately ascribed to an accident. This meant the Edelweisses were not directly put on trial. However, the fact that their passing occurred within the Edelweiss domain still inspired more than a little slander. In an isolated environment like Kjerag, one tiny mistake can be engraved in the collective memory for generations, much less the framing of a great family's leader. This hounded every member of the Edelweiss family, who chose in the end to leave.[NEWLINE]"You want to gain as full an understanding as possible of those working under you. I have no objections to this notion, and so I am willing to disclose the full history of my family. This does not, however, mean that I must tell you what went through my mind as I left Kjerag."[NEWLINE]"I made an appointment with him to meet again in future?"[NEWLINE]"...How could that be?"[NEWLINE]"However, even if he hasn't come, I will still return."</Text>
