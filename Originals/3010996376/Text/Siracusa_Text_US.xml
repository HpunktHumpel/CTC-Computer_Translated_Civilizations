				A taciturn Lupo youth.
				[NEWLINE]Though he declined to disclose his identity, the fact that he comes from Siracusa, coupled with his not-particularly-subtle attire, makes it fairly easy to guess what Vigil's background might be. As such, when he first visited Rhodes Island, a hushed silence followed wherever he went.
				[NEWLINE]But this situation was quickly dispelled before it could turn into trouble‚Äì
				[NEWLINE]During lunchtime, Chiave, a fellow Siracusan, greeted him cheerfully. Aosta and Broca, who were with him at the time, seemed reluctant to show their faces. However, the scenario that people were expecting to break out did not unfold, and Vigil had a calm and cordial conversation with Chiave's gang.
				[NEWLINE]This conversation ended with Chiave's arm around Vigil's shoulder, and Chiave proclaiming to the surrounding operators that his gang would celebrate Vigil's arrival.
				[NEWLINE]According to the recollection of an operator present at the time:
				[NEWLINE]"Had people not already been familiar with Chiave's personality, they might've mistaken him for the one with the higher status back there."

				Establishing ties with Nuova Volsinii was an unexpected opportunity for Rhodes Island, but also poses its own risks.
				[NEWLINE]The reason has nothing to do with Vigil; the city is simply too unique.
				[NEWLINE]The city is a special administrative region acknowledged by Signora Sicilia, where the mafias are not allowed to enter or peddle their influence. Of all the countries across this land, perhaps only in Siracusa can a city like this ‚Äì independent of the existing powers ‚Äì pop up out of thin air without causing widespread panic and backlash.
				[NEWLINE]The existence of this city undeniably represents a future recognized by Signoria Sicilia, a challenge to authority that may well unfold in Siracusa; however, it is also destined to stand in opposition to the other mafias.
				[NEWLINE]Vigil sought out Rhodes Island on the basis of medical needs.
				[NEWLINE]As a rule, Rhodes Island normally tries to avoid cooperating with such politically sensitive entities. However, when Operator Texas brought him and Penance before Dr. Kal'tsit's office, the situation became much more complicated.
				[NEWLINE]He made no effort to conceal the events that had unfolded in Old Volsinii. His vision of the future ultimately moved Rhodes Island, and so this relationship was realized.
				[NEWLINE]His reason for choosing to become an operator seems almost ordained by fate ‚Äì what he said was, he saw how Rhodes Island gathered people from all across the land and all walks of life, and he wanted to spend more time communicating with and learning from them.
				[NEWLINE]He displayed a genuine thirst for knowledge of things beyond Siracusa, and his humility has won him the acknowledgement of most operators.
				[NEWLINE]As such, he has already made many friends, and they openly speak highly of him.
				[NEWLINE]It can even be said that Vigil's arrival changed many peoples' impressions of Siracusans.
				[NEWLINE]Consequently, this has also led him to stay at Rhodes Island for longer periods of time than his identity allows, which Penance frequently berates him for.

				As long as Vigil and Penance are both on the landship at the same time, you will see them dining together.
				[NEWLINE]In order to avoid complicated rumors, after Penance joined Rhodes Island, Vigil would introduce her to the other operators as a big sister figure. While Penance has not really admitted to this point, she has also not gone out of her way to deny it.
				[NEWLINE]However, it is no mystery that both Penance and her ideals are special to him.
				[NEWLINE]"I was brought up to be the famiglia's heir. From the very beginning, I've always been pursuing ways of expanding the famiglia's power, and ways of doing my job more efficiently. I'm not such a noble person." During a chat with the Doctor, when the topic of his origins came up, he smiled and explained: "Now that I think about it, that was from before when Famiglia Texas was liquidated. As the power and influence of the Colombian[sic] famiglie grew, some of their ideals and practices started to leak over into Siracusa as well. For better or worse, Siracusa's famiglie also started to become more 'civilized,' and that affected me to some degree as well."
				[NEWLINE]"Originally, I was going to become someone who would stop at nothing to secure advantages for the famiglia. But, Lavinia... Alright, I'll call her Penance here, since she seems to like that codename. Anyways, after my father brought her into the famiglia, things changed."
				[NEWLINE]After getting to this point, Vigil paused for a while, as if carefully considering his words. "So many things happened along the way, including her dispute with my father. In the end, she decided to accept the position of judge that he arranged for her, but this isn't a story you should be hearing from me ‚Äì ask her yourself if you're interested. Looking back, in the process of learning as much as I could to become an effective leader of the famiglia, I not only learned about Siracusa's rules and Columbia's cunning, but also of the justice she had never given up."
				[NEWLINE]"Unfortunately, Demetri had always been tasked with the responsibility of intel gathering, so he was always running around and had little time to talk to Penance. If he had the same opportunities as me, maybe we wouldn't have turned out like this." He let out a sigh. "Forget it, let's not talk about this anymore."
				[NEWLINE]"In any case, Doctor, I see Penance as a superbly upstanding person. For her to be able to hold onto her ideals in a place like Siracusa is an incredibly rare and precious thing. Plus, my mother passed away at a young age, and my father... though we didn't have a bad relationship by any means, there were certain things that I could not easily share with him, so..." He suddenly showed some hesitation and paused for a while when he got to this point, before finally continuing: "When I was still relatively young, she played both an older sister role, as well as..."
				[NEWLINE]"Vigil, I need to talk to you about the planning of the new city. Also, I heard the quality of your work hasn't been up to par lately; have you been staying up late again?" From not too far away came a clear, pristine female voice. Without a doubt, it belonged to Penance.
				[NEWLINE]"Uhh... Doctor, if you'd excuse me." Vigil stood up and trotted towards the voice, mumbling justifications for himself as he ran: "It's not like I held up the project or anything."
				[NEWLINE]In that rare moment, he appeared to be just another impetuous, fearless youth.

				[NEWLINE]On one hand, even with Rhodes Island's intel network, very little is known about the family's fate. On the other hand, Texas never felt the need to elaborate her past, so there isn't a pressing need to delve into it. After all, her past may one day catch up to her, just as she predicts.

				Penance always carries a certain ideal, hoping to protect the weak people and practice the justice of the code under the influence of the family. Therefore, Siracusa leader by Penance can receive feedback on the happiness of the people, significantly improving regional and population output. However, more population means greater chaos, and how to choose between population and urban happiness in order to achieve maximum output is still a path that needs to be explored for Penance.

				Former Siracusan judge.
				[NEWLINE]During her entrance interview, Operator Penance said that she came to make amends for her past mistakes, telling us that she had been made to betray justice against her will.
				[NEWLINE]Our investigation into events at Siracusa reveals that Penance was made judge with the support of the Bellone family, but unlike other mafia-backed judges, she was not entirely subject to the will of the Bellones, being willing to pronounce guilty sentences for members of the family, something which is almost unheard of in Siracusa. She also maintains a sibling-like relationship with Vigil, leading us to believe that the Bellone family may not be your average Siracusan mafia family. We know little about the former don of the Bellones, however, so more information in this regard must await further discussion with Penance and Vigil.
				[NEWLINE]There were doubts as to whether Penance would be able to adapt to Rhodes Island's legal department, given her clear stance on the inviolability of law and justice, as well as the fact that Rhodes Island often operates in legal grey areas. However, she has shown a proper understanding of our true mission; rather than coming into conflict with operators who have different methods from her, they seem to have an implicit understanding, even quietly helping each other out. Perhaps those who are well-versed in the legal world understand that, deep down, they share the common goal of defending justice, no matter what circumstances may have forced them to do, and no matter what means they use now.

				Penance described the Siracusan legal system in detail.
				[NEWLINE]Nomadic cities in Siracusa are ruled by their respective mafia families, and the legal systems of these cities are an extension of family rule. There are no police, only judges who are responsible for public order, speaking the will of Signora Sicilia.
				[NEWLINE]The vast majority of incidents are taken care of under the table by the families involved, most of them never making it to court. The judges themselves are often informed after the fact that a case has been resolved, or, in some cases, needs them to resolve it quietly. Even when a case does make it to court, the outcome of the trial is often influenced or outright decided by the family.
				[NEWLINE]Those who knew Penance during her time as Judge Lavinia called her a "righteous" judge. In Siracusa, judges labeled as such often end up disappearing or losing part of a limb, as a warning to the other judges.
				[NEWLINE]Penance never ended up that way, though she never thought of herself as particularly righteous.
				[NEWLINE]She told us that she became a judge with the help of the Bellone family. When she was first appointed, the former don of the family had promised her a better future, where she would truly deliver the justice of the law. The nature of the Bellone family seemed to have given her more freedom, but also more pain, as she saw such justice delivered by the family as inherently unjust.
				[NEWLINE]Still, Penance has never allowed her troubles to affect those around her, nor demanded the same of others as she does of herself, as in the case of Vigil, for example. This is mostly because they came from the same place, of course, and Vigil does not exactly lead a healthy lifestyle. As such, most of the other operators show an understanding.

				"We just finished. Won't you congratulate me, Lavinia?"
				[NEWLINE]"...What is it?"
				[NEWLINE]"I've always envied your Bellone backing. Things will go much smoother now that I have famiglia support myself."
				[NEWLINE]"And it feels good to have somebody at your back."
				[NEWLINE]"I would never have let myself look the way you do now, Lavinia, if I were you."
				[NEWLINE]"...How many years have you been a judge?"
				[NEWLINE]"About two."
				[NEWLINE]"Why do you ask?"
				[NEWLINE]"I saw Bortolotti today."
				[NEWLINE]"Who's that?"
				[NEWLINE]"A... judge."
				[NEWLINE]"Now an assassin. He died today, right in front of my eyes. An arrow went through him."
				[NEWLINE]"I'm lucky to be alive."
				[NEWLINE]"Let's just say I never heard anything..."
				[NEWLINE]"Did you think it was a good thing? Do you feel better now that you have a famiglia behind you? Having a famiglia support is what you're proudest about, as a judge?"
				[NEWLINE]"No, it's not my place to reproach you. Bortolotti is dead. He abandoned his ideals before he died, but he held on to his appointment letter. Meanwhile, I'm still here today, breathing and in one piece, because everyone knows that the Bellones are behind Judge Lavinia."
				[NEWLINE]"How did the rule of law come to this in Siracusa? I sit with the mafiosi every day, listening to them telling me what to do, and I do everything in my power to do it well, because it's 'better' for everyone. Everyone goes about their business as usual the next day, because I did."
				[NEWLINE]"But I can see the fear in the eyes of the common folk, the way they keep their distance. After the sentence is pronounced, they dare not cry where there are prying eyes, or make their appeals to a judge."
				[NEWLINE]"What am I doing? Defending the law? Justice? Society? Public order? None of the above. All the judges, all the courts; the entire legal system of Siracusa is designed to be an accomplice for the mafia."
				[NEWLINE]"The people who had high ideals are dead. But I'm alive, and you're alive. I couldn't do anything, while you boast about having famiglia backing."
				[NEWLINE]"There but for the grace of the mafia, goes the law of Siracusa."
				[NEWLINE]"...You're drunk, Lavinia."
				[NEWLINE]"I'm not."
				[NEWLINE]"YES, YOU ARE. I'll be going."

				For Texas, Giovanna and Lappland each represented her past lives in Columbia and Siracusa.
				[NEWLINE]If not for what had happened 7 years ago, she might have become a reticent Lappland, or a cold-blooded Giovanna.
				[NEWLINE]Lappland symbolized hysteria toward Siracusa; she could not face it, but there was nowhere else to go to.
				[NEWLINE]Giovanna represented apprehension toward Columbia; she knew she did not have to do it, but she did not know what else to do.
				[NEWLINE]Texas knows that she would have walked the same paths as them, if she had not run away from it all.
				[NEWLINE]Whenever she came face-to-face with Lappland and Columbia, it filled her with nostalgia, but guilt as well.
				[NEWLINE]That is why she tolerated Lappland's actions, and accepted Giovanna's reproach. She was a Texas, no matter how much she detested everything to do with the family.
				[NEWLINE]She knew the price she paid when she chose to step away from it all.
				[NEWLINE]Was it worth it?
				[NEWLINE]She asked herself this many times, and unsurprisingly was never able to find the answer.
				[NEWLINE]After leaving Columbia and Siracusa, she desperately sought a new life to replace the old one.
				[NEWLINE]For her, life is not about searching for meaning; it was life itself that was worth searching for.

				Texas and Penguin Logistics did not stay in Nuova Volsinii for long.
				[NEWLINE]She returned to Lungmen with the other members soon after the events concluded. Penguin Logistics reopened, and there did not seem to be any changes in their lives.
				[NEWLINE]But she also meant her promise to Vigil: she would be there when Nuova Volsinii needs her.
				[NEWLINE]Nuova Volsinii was established with Signora Sicilia's blessing, and thus most of the families have chosen to sit on the sidelines, keeping an eye on developments. However, this is no more than the calm before the storm.
				[NEWLINE]Texas knows this, as do the rest of Penguin Logistics.
				[NEWLINE]At present, the main reason for them to travel between Lungmen and Nuova Volsinii is not so much Texas as Sora.
				[NEWLINE]The success of La Morte di Texas made Sora a star, prompting Monster Siren Records to change its strategy and encourage her to continue her activities in Siracusa. Nuova Volsinii presents an ideal platform for Sora in more ways than one.
				[NEWLINE]It was Sora, then, who has to regularly make the trip to Nuova Volsinii.
				[NEWLINE]Meanwhile, not wishing to let this opportunity go to waste, Croissant approached Bison and is trying to work with MountainDash Logistics and Vigil to build an international logistics route. It is a monumental task, but Croissant seems to enjoy it.
				[NEWLINE]Exusiai, for her part, has made it her mission to try every pizza parlor in Siracusa and find the best.

				Some people believe that Lappland is a crazy wolf, while others believe that Lappland is covering up her anxiety about the Syracuse order with madness. This may also explain her special treatment of Texas, as she wants to find a crazy way out for Siracusa in Texas. For Lappland, fancy swordsmanship did not add much color to the battle, on the contrary, she preferred direct confrontation. By destroying the enemy's special abilities through spiritual destruction, Lappland is able to quickly pull both sides of the battle to similar levels, only engaging in pure strength competitions. Of course, this strategy is not always effective. For some units, tough pressure can actually break the shackles on their bodies.

				We have struggled to understand Lappland's personality. Some consider her simply mad, despite how polite and personable she can be in daily life. She actively seeks out people to converse with, indulging her taste for gallows humor, eager to see how her conversation partners will respond. Still, we know Lappland to be a dangerous element, and even at her most well-behaved, she remains frightening.
				[NEWLINE]Lappland has been marked for close medical observation due to severe symptoms of Oripathy.
				[NEWLINE]According to as yet unconfirmed reports, Lappland might have come from a certain family in Siracusa known for moving in certain dangerous circles, but scouring all active and inactive lists involving Siracusa failed to connect Lappland to any of the families. Because of the extreme risk involved in probing the Siracusan families, the investigation has been terminated.

				Lappland's Oripathy symptoms go beyond the physical to cause an abnormal obsession toward a certain target of hers, even spurring her to excessive violence.
				[NEWLINE]Although Rhodes Island has exerted some degree of control over her behavior while deployed, she still does more or less whatever she wants in battle, which has been a problem for coordinated operations with her teammates.
				[NEWLINE]Lappland's rather unique symptoms seem to enhance her fighting abilities‚Äîvery rare among Infected. Her weapon, a specially designed eastern-style sword, complements her Arts. She appears to wield her Originium power untrained, through raw talent alone. Even though Lappland's powers decay rapidly when released, her deceptive fighting style and explosive offensive abilities have allowed her to master her weaknesses.
				[NEWLINE]Furthermore, Lappland's uncanny ability to discern weakness neutralizes virtually any advantage an opponent with Originium power or other special ability may have. She is able to counter her enemy's attacks completely after only a few moments of observation.

				Based on scattered reports and eyewitness accounts, Operator Lappland has a close personal connection to Penguin Logistics employee Texas, a liaison from the company to Rhodes Island. Texas, for her part, makes a concerted effort to avoid contact with Lappland. Still, in situations where they were forced to work together, Lappland has not gone out of her way to antagonize Texas. In fact, she seems to be taking some degree of pleasure in Texas playing hard-to-get, as it were.
				[NEWLINE]Lappland treats other PL personnel cordially, but they have not warmed to her, and their meetings are always rather awkward (though thankfully rare).
				[NEWLINE]Lappland tries to get along with other Rhodes Island Operators, as long as no one gets in her way.
				[NEWLINE][Classified Log]
				[NEWLINE]All Lupus Operators display a guarded reaction to Operator Projekt Red's presence, with Operator Lappland exhibiting the most intense, most uncontrollable aura of dread and animosity, as well as inexplicable-euphoria. Until a solution is devised to mitigate the tension, keeping the two separated is advised.
